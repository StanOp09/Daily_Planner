# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The average day is filled with lots of activities which often times can be overwhelming and dificult to monitor. There is the danger of missing key responsiblities and duties that could delay or negatively impact productivity or progress. Having a schedular that could break activities into hour blocks and allow one to save activities can help manage time effectively. This project aims to accomplish this task.
